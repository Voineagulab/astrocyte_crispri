These scripts perform differential expression analyses, comparing single-cells with a given guide (or guide set) to those without. All code is in R. 

3a-b preprocess the scRNA-seq expression data from 1_RawDataProcessing. Here, cells are called, annotated, and filtered, and assigned with the sgRNAs they target

3c runs differential expression using SCEPTRE. 3d and 3e analyse this output, for positive control guides (targeting TSSs) and candidate enhancer-targeting guides, respectively. Note that the latter represents the primary result of the screen, selecting functional enhancer gene pairs (n=158, from 145 unique enhancers regulating 116 unique genes), and performing some basic characterisation.

3f performs a simple power analysis based on downsampling our observed data.
