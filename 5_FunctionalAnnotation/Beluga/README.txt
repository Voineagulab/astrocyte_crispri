getFasta.sh Extract FASTA sequences for enhancer regions
1_KnownVariants.R Extracts SNPs located within a 1 kb window of the tested enhancers and predicts their disease-impact scores (DIS) using Beluga.
2_CreateVCF.R Creates VCFs for all possible sequence variants at each nucleotide position for the 145 functional enhancers
3_BelugaVariants.R Processes the Beluga outputs for the 145 functional enhancers.
4.1_BedToBigWig.R & 4.2_BedToBigWig.sh Create BigWig files for visualization in genome browsers
5.ISM_Beluga_CCL2.R Compares Disease impact score (DIS) values between SNPs within 1kb of functional hits and powered non-hit and explore the in-silico mutagenesis data  generated for Enh427 (which regulates the expression of CCL2)


Run order for Beluga disease variants vcf (all positions in Hits):
First run ../getFasta.sh to extract FASTA sequences from the HG38 genome. 
Next, execute createVCFs.R to generate VCF files, ensuring positions are adjusted by +1 (posplus1) to match Belugaâ€™s reference genome format. 
Then, upload the VCF files to the Beluga web tool, selecting Model: Beluga and Genome: HG38. BelugaVariants.R to parse the disease impact scores (DIS), merge results with enhancer data, and perform downstream analyses.
