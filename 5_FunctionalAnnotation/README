Scripts in this folder concern the functional annotation of our functional enhancers and their regulated genes. They are organised by theme.

./Beluga: predicting the effect of known and hypothetical variants in functional enhancers using  *in silico* mutagenesis, courtesy of the Beluga algorithm (Zhou et al., 2019: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0160-6)

./Chromatin: these R scripts explore the chromatin properties of functional enhancers, such as superenhancer status, or changes in chromatin state across tissues and development.

./EnhancerTranscription: TTseq and CAGE expression at functional enhancers.

./EnhGenePairs: 
    EnhGenePairs.R: functional annotations that relate to the pair, rather than either component individually.
    TF_CytoscapeAstronet.R: construction of the TF-enhancer-gene regulatory network.

./RegulatedGenes: R scripts that annotates hit genes with ontology enrichments, disease and phenotype data, cell-type and tissue regulation, and astrocyte-specific expression in disorders.

./Tobias_TFs: TOBIAS (Bentsen et al., 2020; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18035-1) is an algorithm for transcription factor (TF) binding from an ATAC-seq signal. These scripts run the algorithm and explore TF binding patterns in functional enhancers and inactive candidates.

./Variants: Common SNPs were assigned to functional enhancers using overlap and linkage disequilibrium. These scripts perform that assignment, and explore the functional annotations of those variants.

WGCNAenh.R: Co-variation network construction using pseudo-bulked ATAC-seq data.
