These scripts contain code to select our 979 candidate enhancer regions, as well as design sgRNA to silence them in NHA cells

2a: annotation of NHA ATAC-seq peaks and filtering to final candidate set
2b: prioritisation of top sgRNA for each candidate enhancer
2c: selection of positive control guides validated by Gasperini et al. (2019) in K562 cells
2d: creating a list of the final guides
2e: comparison of gene expression in NHA cells with and without dCas9-KRAB integration
2f: comparison of gene expression in NHA cells with data from immunopanned astrocytes
