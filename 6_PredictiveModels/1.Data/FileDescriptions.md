- **RNAseq_FeatCounts.csv**: Gene expression data used for defining expressed genes when predicting significant EG pairs outside the candidate enhancer set. Count data is generated by ribodepleted RNAseq. TT-seq data is included as it was generated in the same sequencing run but not used for filtering.

### /Astrocytes/Processed_ChIP_ENCODE

ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data from NHA astrocytes, ChIP-seq data for K562 cells. BigWig files were downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/.
.tab files contain ChIP-seq/DNase-seq coverage of candidate enhancers from the CRISPRi astrocyte screen, generated using bigWigAverageOverBed (./Scripts/InputDataProcessing/Process_ChIP_DNase.sh).
The **Intergenic** subdirectory contains .tab files generated as above, for intergenic ATAC-seq peaks not tested in the CRISPRi screen.
