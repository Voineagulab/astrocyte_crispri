### ASTROCYES
rE2G predictions for Astrocytes were downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/.
"all" and "th" refers to all EG pairs and thresholded EG pair data respectively
The astrocyte_Donor_ENCDO916IIE sample corresponds to NHA astrocytes(Lonza) and was used for comparison with the Astrocyte CRISPRi data generated from the same cell type.

astrocyte_Donor_ENCDO916IIE:
ENCFF405VJJ.th.bed
ENCFF440FMQ.all.bed

ENCFF440FMQ.bed contains the overlap between candidate enhancers from the CRISPRi astrocyte screen and ENCFF440FMQ.all.bed and is provided in ./InputData/Astrocytes.
