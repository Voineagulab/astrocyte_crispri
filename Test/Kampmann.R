## Kampmann paper

# First, use ST4. This concerns cluster markers, with 1,2,and4 marking cytokine-treated cells, and 0 being the biggest

## Next, use ST6. This contains DE upon KD of 30 TFs, contrast this to yours!
  ## NOte that NFKB1, RELA, SP2, CEBPD, FOXP2 HIF1A STAT3 ZNF148 NFIL3 AND IRF8  are enriched for cluster1 markers
  ## While STAT1 IRF1 NFKB STAT3 PTTG1 TP53 RELA RBMX IKBKB AND HDGF are enriched for Cluster2 markers
